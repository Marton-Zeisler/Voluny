Voluny is a quick, easy and simple volunteering app that is tailored specifically for volunteers who love to help out their community as well as to recruiters, who are seeking for volunteers for their organizations.

## The Bay Area Team
We consist of 2 team members that make this wonderful app happen: Uyen Vicky Vo as the UIUX designer and [Marton Zeisler](https://github.com/Marton-Zeisler) as the programmer. We came up with the idea together and have been working hard on Voluny starting from scratch. We use Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch for UIUX designing and Xcode/Swift for developing. In addition, Firebase, Google APIs (Geocoding & Places API) was being used for the back-end development. 

## Installation Guidelines
There are two ways to test Voluny:
 - This repository contains an executable .ipa file in the ipa folder. In order to install and run this file you need to have a jailbroken iPhone. Download the .ipa file using this link: [Download Voluny.ipa](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1zHikbY5PuwYGUCoc4V14TX5YO0BnkTfu)

 - Another way to install Voluny is by inviting me to an Apple developer account and allowing me to upload the application to Testflight. TestFlight is Apple's online service for testing mobile applications but it is only possible with paid Apple developer accounts. An Apple developer account costs 99 dollars per year.

“Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much” – Helen Keller.

We believe in the power of people. You and I, as individuals, do great things. But did you know that we do greater things when we come together. If I ask anyone, “Do you like helping people?”, the morality answer is always, “Yes”. Of course, everyone wants to help everyone else. Do you have the time? Yes. Do you have the will? Yes. Do you care about your community? Yes. But really, do you have the patience to sit for hours on your computer? To search on countless websites for volunteer experiences? To apply through a long chain of emails only to find out that the time doesn’t work for you? Yeah, we don’t think so. 

That’s where Voluny comes in and solves this problem.

So… what’s our goal? Our goal is simple, just like how we want our app to be, because let’s be real, finding volunteer experiences should not be painful or stressful or take up your whole day. We don’t believe in making users sign up or commit to anything until they find what they are looking for. We want the user experience to be seamless. We want them to focus on just one thing that matters: looking for the volunteer opportunities they love.

As the volunteer, the decision is all yours. Apply to 1, 2 or 10 experiences you want. No one is stopping you. We can’t. You can join, search, and apply for volunteer experiences within a few minutes. In addition, we created a variety of categories including Children, Pets, Homeless, Education and more. It is important that we let you have the flexibility to choose your cause and the volunteer experiences you wish to apply–giving total control to you.

The other goal of Voluny is to make the user experience seamless, without any confusion. We care about your experience, that’s why it’s important for us to design a seamless UX management tool that only shows you what you want to know. After you apply, you can easily keep track of your applications to see if you are a good match to what the organization is looking for, receive all the information you need to start without having to contact back and forth with the organizations.

To ensure that everyone has the best experience, we also created a rating system to help you express yourself. The ratings will be seen by everyone and will help future volunteers to understand more about the experience they had with the organization and easily decide where they want to volunteer next.

We understand that as a recruiter, you already have enough things to worry about. With our app as the recruiter, who represents the organization, you can post new volunteer experiences within minutes without complicated hassles. The recruiter can manage current or past listings through the recruiter portal.

Our intention is to make things quick and simple. It is important that making decision should not take away your precious time. That’s why we make it simple for you to decide if the candidate is a good match by simply clicking “Accept” or “Decline” after you preview their information. With our easy managing tool, you will be able to edit, delete or modify your listing, as well as having an overview of your volunteer experience.
